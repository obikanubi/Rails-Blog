# Simple Blog

This is a blogsite I created to learn MVP and CRUD concepts in Ruby and Rails. Having two week's worth of experience on Ruby, creating this simple web application was made possible by following the step by step guide on [RailsGuides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
